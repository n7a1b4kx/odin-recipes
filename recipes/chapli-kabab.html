    <p class="first para">
        Chapli kebab is a beloved Pakistani dish, hailing from the historical city of Peshawar. This flavorful kebab is renowned for its unique blend of spices and its distinctive flat, oval shape. The name "chapli" is derived from the Pashto word "chaprikh," meaning "flat," perfectly describing the kebab's appearance.

        Chapli kebabs are typically made with minced beef or mutton, along with a variety of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, red chili powder, and garam masala. The meat is often marinated in yogurt and lemon juice, which tenderizes it and enhances the flavor. The kebabs are then grilled to perfection over hot coals, resulting in a crispy exterior and juicy interior.
