        <h2>About Nihari</h2>
        <p>
            Nihari is a rich and flavorful stew originating from the Indian subcontinent, believed to have been born in the royal kitchens of Lucknow during the Mughal era. It's traditionally made with slow-cooked meat, often beef shank or lamb, along with bone marrow. The meat is simmered for hours in a flavorful gravy infused with aromatic spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and black peppercorns.

            The name "nihari" is derived from the Arabic word "nahar," meaning "morning," as it was historically consumed as a hearty breakfast dish. Its rich and comforting nature made it a popular choice for laborers, providing them with the energy needed for a long day of work. Today, nihari remains a beloved dish, often enjoyed during special occasions and festivals. It's typically served with naan or tandoori roti, allowing you to soak up every last drop of the flavorful gravy.
