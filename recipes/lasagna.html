    <h2>About Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that involves layering wide, flat pasta sheets with a rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella cheese. The dish is typically baked in a casserole dish until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
    </p>
    <p>
        The meat sauce, often made with ground beef or sausage, is simmered with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like oregano and basil. The ricotta cheese adds a creamy texture, while the mozzarella provides a gooey, cheesy topping.
