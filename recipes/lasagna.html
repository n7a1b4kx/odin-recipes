        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that involves layering wide, flat pasta sheets with a rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella cheese. The dish is typically baked in a casserole dish until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.

        The meat sauce, often made with ground beef or sausage, is simmered with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like oregano and basil. The ricotta cheese adds a creamy texture, while the mozzarella provides a gooey, cheesy topping.
